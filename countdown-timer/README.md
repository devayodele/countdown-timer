# Javascript Countdown Timer

***

In this project, a countdown timer is built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

The countdown timer will refresh itself every second (no need for the user to reset the page). To create a new countdown, all that needs to be input is a new countdown time and date. The JavaScript program then takes care of all the necessary calculations to produce the countdown.
